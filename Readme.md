# CSMS

CSMS (charging station management system) is used to manage charging stations, charging
processes and customers (eDrivers) amongst other things. One of functionalities of such a CSMS is to calculate a price to a particular charging process so that the eDriver can be invoiced for the consumed services. Establishing a price for a charging process is usually done by applying a rate to the CDR (charge detail record) of the corresponding charging process which is implemented here.
